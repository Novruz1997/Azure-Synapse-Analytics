It will read entire\ndata. But we can do this so, it will read only the date (partition) which we need .\n\n*/\n\n\nDROP VIEW IF EXISTS bronze.vw_trip_data_green_csv\n\nGO \n\nUSE nyc_taxi_ldw;\n\nCREATE VIEW bronze.vw_trip_data_green_csv\nAS \nSELECT \n    result.filepath(1) as year,\n    result.filepath(2) as month,\n    result.*\nFROM OPENROWSET(\n    BULK 'raw/trip_data_green_csv/year=*/month=*/*.csv',\n    DATA_SOURCE = 'nyc_taxi_src',\n    FORMAT = 'CSV',\n    PARSER_VERSION = '2.0',\n    HEADER_ROW = TRUE\n) AS [result]\n\n-- So, above our view has the year and month columns as well.\n\n-- Now we can get data only from specific partition.\n\n\n-- Execute this and look messages.
